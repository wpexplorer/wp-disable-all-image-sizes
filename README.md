# WP Disable All Image Sizes
A little plugin based on our tutorial [Stop WordPress from Creating Extra Cropped Image Sizes](https://www.wpexplorer.com/stop-wordpress-from-creating-extra-cropped-image-sizes/)

The plugin will prevent WordPress from creating new image sizes when uploading images to your site.

## How to Install the Plugin?
Head over to [releases](https://github.com/wpexplorer/wp-disable-all-image-sizes/releases) download the latest version. Once the zip has downloaded it will have the format wp-disable-all-image-sizes-{version}. You can upload this zip file, but we recommend you instead unzip the folder, rename it to just "disable-block-patterns", re-zip then upload it to your site.
